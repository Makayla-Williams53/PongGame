# PongGame

## Final for Advanced Java

This was my final for my high school Advanced Java class in December of 2022. We had to pick a new topic to learn and create 
an Android Stuiod app to demonstrate that new topic. I chose to do this in the form of learning constraint
layout by making the classic game of Pong. I used constraing layouts to set up the pong board and paddles, then using the 
paint classes I drew in the ball and paddles and they moved.
